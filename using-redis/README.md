# Using Redis

## Introduction
Be cautious though, because this technique could blow up your redis usage.

## Getting Started
Setup your redis instance. Here, I am using upstash, since its free and easy to setup (not sponsored). Setup here: https://upstash.com/

Install
```bash
pnpm install
```
Run
```bash
pnpm dev
```
